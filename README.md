# Learn APL

Learning APL jupyterbook. See it in its published state on https://xpqz.github.io/learnapl

If you prefer, you can download the whole thing as a single [pdf file](https://github.com/xpqz/learnapl/blob/3f73b88c58c7b0f1e601bae19c6326fc9ac40a36/contents/_build/pdf/book.pdf).

If you find errors, please raise an issue so I can fix it.

This is -- and will remain -- a work in progress; I'll keep adding material sporadically.

Many thanks for checking it out! For APL-related conversations, try the [APL Orchard](https://apl.chat) chat room.

I gave a presentation on how and why this book came to be at the Dyalog '21 conference. You can watch it [here](https://dyalog.tv/Dyalog21/?v=qrWCYPFfsCU).
